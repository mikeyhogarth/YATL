This is purely a learning exercise and has no real world practical applications (other than to see an 
implementation of a TODO list in node.js with the following features);

* MongoDB data storage using mongoose
* Powered by the Express.js framework
* Full todo CRUD using MVC
* Full unit and integration tests
* Environment-specific config settings
* Pagination
* Sorting
* Filtering

To use: 

set up a local `.env` file (see the example in the repo) and then run;

```
npm install --save
npm start
```
